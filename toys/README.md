* Mostly Me
    * [UnicodeRGB](UnicodeRGB) - A simple canvas experiment.
    * [Hexaflexagon Creator](hexaflexagon)
    * [Space Curling](space_curling/space_curling.html) - A 2002 Palm pilot game running in an emulator.
* Me + AI (Claude in VSCode mostly)
    * [Sierpinski and friends](sierpinski/main.html).
    * [3D texture in webGL](webgl_3d_texture/main.html). Kinda broken. 
    * [Silly TV Position thing](tv_position/tv_position.html) - Another AI experiment. Having this deal with viewport width is something where I don't think the models are currently able to have the conversation with me.
    * [Drop stuff!] AI + matter.js 2D physics experiment.
