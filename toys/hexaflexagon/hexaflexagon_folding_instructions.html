<h1>Hexaflexagon Folding Instructions</h1>

<p>
<!--
These instructions make the following assumptions
<ul>
<li>You have printed out a hexaflexagon in 'Standard' view.
<li>You have either printed out or have easy access to Parts 1+2 of the instruction figures for the same flexagon. 
</ul>
See the <a href="user_guide.html">User Guide</a> if the above doesn't make sense 
to you.
Good luck!

<ol start="1" type="1">
  <li>First cut out the printed shape.</li>
  <li>Fold the shape in half lengthways. You should now have a 
  single triangle wide strip printed on both sides.</li>
  <li>Find the end of your strip that matches the two triangles at the 
  top end of <i>Figure</i> <i>i.</i> Certain custom image combinations can make 
  it difficult to work out which end this is. If this happens notice that the 
  back side of the top of the strip should be
</font>

  <font face="Arial"><b>GLUE X</b></font><font size="+1">.</li>
  <li>Fold the top two triangles away from you, along the 
  dotted line. Afterwards your strip should look like the right hand picture in
  <i>Figure i.</i></li>
  <li>Next, fold the top portion away from you, along the 
  dotted line in the left hand image of <i>Figure ii. </i>Again, you should end 
  up with the right hand image.</li>
  <li>Folding away along the line in the right image in <i>Figure 
  ii </i>should leave you with <i>Figure iii.</i> Fold top sections 
  away from yourself along the dotted lines.</li>
  <li>Continue in this manner, folding two triangles at a 
  time, until you again have a single strip. The two sides of the strip should 
  look like the top and bottom rows in <i>Figure iv.</i> If you're having 
  trouble, the folds in this section should all be the same way, a wrapping 
  pattern rather than a zigzag.</li>
  <li>Flip the flexagon so you're looking at the bottom row of <i>Figure iv. </i>
  As usual along the dotted line, fold the right hand side away from you. Reorient the flexagon so 
  it is in the same position as seen in <i>Figure v. </i>Check the bottom right 
  triangle to ensure it matches the image. If everything apart from this 
  triangle is correct, you've folded in the right place, but folded the wrong 
  way.</li>
  <li>Fold the top section away from you in the usual manner. 
  You should now have a nearly complete picture as seen in <i>Figure vi. </i>
  </li>
  <li>Underneath the lower-left triangle (it will be the only 
  one that is not from Image1) you will see the other end of the strip with the 
  second glue tab on it. Lift it up and over the aforementioned lower left 
  triangle. The two glue triangles should be next to each other as seen in <i>
  Figure vii. </i></li>
  <li>Fold the left glue tab over and stick it to the other 
  one (A small piece of doubled over tape works well for us)</li>
  <li>Flex away! <!--(Instructions to come)--></li>
</ol>
<p>You may find the hexaflexagon a little stiff at first, but it should soften 
with age.</p>
<p>Comments and suggestions are most welcome!</p>
